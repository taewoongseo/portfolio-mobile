			<p>Coco is a Pixar film that portrayed components of Mexican culture very well. It tells a story about a boy Miguel who lives
			with his big family in Mexico, who aspires to be a guitarist, despite his family's strong hatred and ban on music in the 
			family. During the Día de los Muertos, or the Day of the Dead, Miguel magically ends up in the Land of the Dead where he meets
			his deceased family members and more.

				Although Coco is a film made and produced in Hollywood through Disney and Pixar, I thought this film definitely promoted
				a perspective of diverse culture that the mainstream audience in the United States were not as used to. The film takes
				place during the Día de los Muertos, which is a holiday celebrated and observed in Mexico. The holiday is called the 
				Day of the Dead in English, and it's a joyful celebration of the dead in which friends and families take time to pay
				respects and remember the deceased. Coco is one film that introduces this culture very thoroughly. 
				In Mexico, during the holiday, families prepare food and drinks that the departed liked. They decorate the graves and
				cemeteries with flowers and goods to celebrate the souls.  
				</p>

			<p>
				In addition to the food and beverages, people also put up photos and memorabilia of the departed. They do this because
				they hope that the souls of their families and friends can come visit them more easily and be part of the celebration.
				Also, another intention is to remember and think about the deceased during the holiday as well. 
			</p>

			<p>In the movie, it's shown that family members put up pictures of the other family members who passed away to pay respects.
				This becomes a very important element in the movie's plot, as having the photos up is the only way that the deceased ones
				can cross the bridge to the land of the living and see their family and friends. One of the protagonists Hector, whom Miguel
				encounters in the Land of the Dead, is worried because he doesn't have any family or friends who would remember him and 
				put the photo of him. This culture of remembering and paying respects to someone by putting the photo during the Day of 
				the Dead is really highlighted through this story setting in Coco. 
				</p>

			<p>
				One interesting thing that I found when I first watched this film is how festive and celebrative this Day of the Dead holiday
				can be. In a lot of Western culture, events of remembering and paying respects to the departed are often filled with
				sorrow and mourning. However, this movie introduced me to this new culture and way of thinking about the deceased. The Day
				of the Dead is portrayed as a joyful celebration in which families and friends get to reunite with their loved ones that have
				passed away. This idea seemed a lot different from what I was used to, and it really changed the way I thought about the
				deceased ones. 
			</p>

			<p>
				It's also important to note that Miguel's deceased family members are potrayed as not frightening but friendly characters.
				Often it's easy to associate the departed with horror, as depicted in many Hollywood horror films. However, how Coco
				brings these deceased characters is bright in comparison and almost comical as well. This shows to me a very different
				take on how we think about the deceased people, especially ones that are part of your family and friends.  
			</p>

			<p>
				The importance of music in Mexican culture is another important theme of the film. Miguel, the protagonist, wants to be a
				musician like his idol singer, and he tries to perform at music competitions despite his family being opposed to it.
				Mexican music has a lot of genres influenced by Latin American culture and countries, and having music in any celebration,
				big or small, is essential part of the culture. Genres like Mariachi and Ranchera are very famous and widely-played Mexican
				song genres and styles, and they are performed to depict joy, love, passion, sorrow, and many other emotions.
