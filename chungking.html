				Chungking Express is a Hong Kong romantic drama film that was released in 1994. The film consists of two different shorter
				stories, but both stories deliver a plot about a Hong Kong police officer missing and wanting a woman.
				The first story is about a policeman who just went through a breakup and encounters a drug smuggler who is trying to
				survive after a drug deal falls apart. The second story is about another Hong Kong policeman who also went through a breakup
				encountering a staff member at a midnight snack store. The policeman misses her former girlfriend and everything in his place
				reminds him of her. Finding out about his loneliness and sorrow, the staff member secretly breaks into his apartment and 
				decorates and cleans the place, which eventually cheers the policeman up.

				Hong Kong has led the cinema and film industry in Asia in the 60s to the 90s, with a lot of great masterpieces produced.
				Chungking Express is one of the films that a lot of moviegoers pick as one of their top films. It depicts lives in
				Hong Kong in a very authentic way, which definitely plays a big part in introducing a diverse culture to the audience.
				Personally, I lived in Hong Kong for a few years, so what Chungking Express delivers connects a lot to me as well. 
			</p>

				Chungking Express, on the surface, tells us stories about love and loss of the characters' loved ones. However, I think
				this represents how Hong Kong as a whole felt in this time era historically. A little background about Hong Kong is that
				in the late 1800s, the Great Britain took over Hong Kong as a colony after winning the Opium War against China. Over 100
				years since then, Hong Kong remained a British colony technically, while having its own independent culture of
				its Chinese root mixed with the Western culture from the UK. However, in 1997, when the "lease" of
				taking a region in Hong Kong from China was coming to an end. This left a lot of Hong Kong citizens in confusion, fear,
				and concerns because for the past 100 years, they had formed their own identity and culture as Hong Kong, but it was 
				about to get taken away by merging back with mainland China. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				This film Chungking Express shows the confusion and feeling of loss that the Hong Kong citizens must have felt in the
				late 1990s when they were facing the handover to China. The two main characters in the film are going through breakups
				in solitude. The policeman in the second story even starts having conversations with objects as he faced a big loss
				and feels lonely. This reflects how the Hong Kongers must have felt when they were facing the loss of their Hong Kong
				that had a certain identity.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				The feeling of anxiety and confusion due to the upcoming handover in the 1990s is visually depicted in Chungking Express
				as well. The director purposefully used a lot of shaky, handheld style of filming as well as tilted angles to reflect
				how anxious the characters feel in the movie. These unstable cinematography does give anxiety to the audience, connecting
				back to the anxious and unstable emotions that the Hong Kong citizens must have had with the Hong Kong - China handover. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				This film also highlights diversity shown in Hong Kong as well. The title of the movie Chungking Express comes from
				where the first story takes place - Chungking Mansions. It's a hotel and service building located in Hong Kong which
				is known to be a hub of people from diverse ethnical and cultural backgrounds. It has a unique nickname of "little
				United Nations" for this reason. Since it's a relatively cheap place to stay for travelers and visitors, a lot of
				foreigners from South India, Southeast Asia, Europe, and Africa have been residing there. It even has a few restaurants
				with very diverse cousines from all over the world. Although this building was once infamous for having crimes like
				drug deals depicted in Chungking Express, it still plays a big role in keeping Hong Kong as a globalized, diverse city.
